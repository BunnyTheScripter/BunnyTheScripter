## 💜 Hello, my name is bunny!

I am a programmer passionate about Lua. Although I program exclusively in Lua, I can develop almost anything! My focus is on the backend, but I also do very well on the front end when the situation calls for it.

🔭 Currently, I am working on a project that uses Lua to create robust and efficient solutions, integrating functionalities both for the server side and for interactive web interfaces.

💬 If you have any questions about Lua programming, want to exchange ideas about development, or chat about projects, feel free to get in touch!
